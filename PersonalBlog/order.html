                Last week flew by and before I knew it, it was time to plan the menu
                for Sunday dinner. Sundays have been a perfect opportunity for me to
                experiment with new dessert recipes, especially those that serve tons
                of people, since we have help polishing it all off and don't have it
                sitting around the house, tempting us for days.

            <p>
                I have long associated German Chocolate Cake with Father's Day,
                although I'm not entirely sure why. I think I remember my mom making
                it for my dad once or twice growing up (although never on Father's
                Day, ironically) and the correlation must have stuck somewhere along
                the way.
