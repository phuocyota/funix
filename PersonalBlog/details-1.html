        <h2>Yellow cake with chocolate frosting</h2>
        <p>
          This fluffy vanilla cake recipe is the absolute best yellow cake from
          scratch and paored with the silky smooth chocolate frosting, you can't
          beat it for a classic birthday cake or any other celebration!
        </p>

        <p>
          Are you a box mix yellow cake person? Or a from-scratch yellow cake
          person?
        </p>
        <p>
          Truth be told, it's REALLY hard to replicate that
          always-moist-and-fluffy texture that everyone loves about a box cake
          mix, but at the same time, we also love homemade, right?!
        </p>
        <p>
          It took me a LONG time to find a homemade yellow cake that I really,
          really loved. Box cake mixes seem to always bake up perfectly fluffy
          and moist yellow cakes, and the ones I've had from bakeries have been
          great as well, but I just couldn't seem to replicate it at home no
          matter how many recipes I tried. (Consequently, I haven't had the same
          issue with chocolate cakes! See: Snickers Cake - the base recipe for
          all of my chocolate cakes!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Many were too dense, too dry, too chiffon-like, too fussy in their
          preparation. I just wanted a fantastic yellow cake recipe I could use
          for birthdily cakes that was easy to make and turned out delicious. I
          came across this recipe from Joy while I was on the hunt for yet
          another recipe to test out for Joseph's birthday.
        </p>
        <p>This was IT.The recipe that had eluded me for years!</p>
        <img src="./images/yellow-cake-chocolate-frosting-2.jpg" />
        <p>
          I love that this can easily be mixed together in one bowl using my
          hand mixer; there's nothing fussy about the ingredients or
          preparation, and it produces an absolutely perfect yellow cake. The
          layers are light but sturdy, buttery and moist, and the ideal base for
          your very favorite chocolate frosting.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used the chocolate frosting recipe from my ultimate chocolate
          cupcakes, and it was a wonderful companion to this cake. The frosting
          is more buttery than sugary, satiny smooth and full of rich chocolate
          flavor It glides on like a dream!
        </p>

          Yellow cake tends to be the elusive unicorn of homemade baking; so
          many cakes can turn out too dry, too crumbly, too dense, too
          combread-like, and I have one major piece of advice for ensuring
          yellow cake perfection:
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Make sure all of the ingredients listed "at room temperature" ARE
            ACTUALLY AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          I've totally been there and have used still-cool butter, eggs or dairy
          in a recipe when I'm in a hurry, but it's actually vitally important
          here. Having all of those ingredients at room temperature ensures that
          they emulsify, which traps air in the batter once in the oven, that
          air expands and produces a fluffy cake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Room temperature ingredients that the batter comes together well and
          is ultra-smooth keeps the resulting cake from being crumbly or
          combread-like.
