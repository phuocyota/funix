      <h2>German Chocolate Cake</h2>
      <p>
        The BEST homemade German Chocolate Cake with layers of coconut pecan
        frosting and chocolate frosting. This cake is incredible!

        I think the hundreds of reviews of this recipe speak for themselves,
        but let me add my own testament that this German Chocolate Cake is THE
        CAKE that every person in my family requested for their birthday
        growing up. I was super lucky, being a twin, because my mom would make
        both of our favorites: German chocolate cake for my sister, and carrot
        cake for me!

        To Freeze: After baking the cake layers, allow them to cool
        completely, then wrap them well in plastic wrap and stick each layer
        in a ziplock freezer bag. Freeze for up to three months. Frost the
        cakes when they are frozen they are much easier to frost this way! The
        assembled German Chocolate Cake can also be frozen, covered well, for
        2-3 months (I recommend slicing the cake and wrapping each slice
        really well in plastic wrap, then placing in a freezer-safe container,
        for best results). Allow to come to room temperature before serving.
