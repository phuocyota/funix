        <h2>Cream Cheese Pound Cake</h2>
        <p>
          This recipe produces a perfect cream cheese pound cake. After
          persistent recipe testing with many failures, I found the best ratio
          of ingredients to produce a moist, dense, and flavorful pound cake.
          Using 9 simple ingredients, this cream cheese pound cake recipe will
          be your new favorite. To prevent a ruined cake, follow the baking time
          and temperature closely.

          Until recently, I had never made really good plain pound cake. I have
          delicious lemon pound cake, raspberry swirl pound cake, and brown
          butter pound cake in my back pocket, but regular pound cake has always
          been a disappointment. It was so hard for me to tackle this recipe
          because pound cake can easily turn out dry, rock solid, and/or lacking
          flavor.

          But then I began adding cream cheese and sour cream to the cake
          batter. And my long history of pound cake disappointments began fading
          away.

          down from generation to the generation that will always be a hit. With
          a lovely texture unlike my Kentucky Butter Cake, Sock It To Me Cake,
          Butter Pound Cake and Sour Cream Pound Cake, this is a recipe that
          stands out from all the rest!
